# BUET MSc CSE Preparation – Daily Goal-Based Routine

**Available Time:** 2–4 hours per day  
**Strategy:** Concept → Practice → Revision → Problem Solving  
**Focus:** Strong fundamentals + BUET-style problem solving

---

## ⏰ Daily Time Structure

| Time Available | What To Do |
|---------------|------------|
| 2 Hours Day   | 1 hr Theory + 1 hr Problem Solving |
| 3 Hours Day   | 1.5 hr Theory + 1.5 hr Problems |
| 4 Hours Day   | 2 hr Theory + 2 hr Problems/Revision |

> Always split time between **learning** and **solving**. Only reading = weak preparation.

# 📅 Weekly Subject Cycle

Repeat this cycle every week.

| Day | Subject | Goals |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Day 1 | Data Structures | Learn concept + Solve 5 problems |
| Day 2 | Algorithms | Learn technique + Solve 4 problems |
| Day 3 | Discrete Math | Theory + 10 math/logical problems |
| Day 4 | Computer Organization | Logic, number systems, K-map |
| Day 5 | Operating Systems | One core topic + numericals |
| Day 6 | Database Systems | Theory + SQL/Normalization |
| Day 7 | Computer Networks + Revision | Concepts + subnetting/numericals |

# 📘 Daily Study Blueprint

## 🔹 First Hour – Concept Building
- Read from book or notes
- Watch 1 short lecture (if needed)
- Write key formulas, definitions, diagrams

## 🔹 Second Hour – Problem Solving
- Solve textbook or past questions
- Focus on **written solutions**, not just thinking
- Mark problems you couldn’t solve

## 🔹 Extra Time (If 3–4 hrs available)
- Revise previous topics
- Practice previous BUET questions
- Work on weak areas

# 🔁 Daily Revision Rule (Very Important)

Every day before starting new study:

- Spend **10–15 minutes** reviewing yesterday’s topic
- Re-solve 1 old problem without looking at solution

This builds long-term memory.

---

# 🧪 Weekly Self-Test (Every 7 Days)

At the end of Day 7:

- Take 1–2 hour mock test
- Mix questions from all subjects
- Identify weak topics
- Next week → give extra time to weak areas

---

# 🚀 Monthly Milestones

| Month | Target |
|------|--------|
| Month 1 | Finish basic theory of all subjects |
| Month 2 | Start solving BUET previous questions |
| Month 3 | Strong in problem solving + weak topic repair |
| Month 4 | Full revision + mock tests only |

---

# 🧩 Golden Rules

✔ Write answers on paper, not only reading  
✔ Focus on **problem solving**, not just theory  
✔ Revise weekly  
✔ Practice previous BUET questions repeatedly
